Ever feel hopeless? Just don&#8217;t have the motivation that you need to get anything done? Most people at one point feel this way, that nothing is working, that what you&#8217;re doing with your life is useless, that what you once thought was great &#8211; turned out not to be.

Here are 6 secrets you can use to get your motivation and drive back.

&nbsp;

<h1 id="secret1" style="text-align: center;">
  Secret #1
</h1>

> Get clear on what your fire is and what energizes you.

You need, no, ***you crave*** that fire.

Think back to the last time you had that fire, that determination, that need to get things done. Think about the greatness that you felt, *that power*, that energy you had. It could have been last week, last year, 10 years, 50 years, it doesn&#8217;t matter just think back to how happy and determined you were and what pushed you and kept pushing you to finish what needed to be done.

Everyone&#8217;s reasons for being motivated are different &#8211; power, money, commitment, love, etc. Your source of motivation may be different than the persons next to you, and if you can understand why you were motivated in the past, you can, and will be able to jump start your motivational drive again.

> Write down goals and commit to them.

Your goals can be a major motivational force to get what you want done.

Write down everything that you want to accomplish, and I mean everything! Whether that be the project you need the motivation for, or that dream of yours to go to Bahamas, just write down all your goals. Why? Because, they are all linked together in some form or another &#8211; and realizing what your goals for everything can get you to stand up, get to work, and get them done.

<h1 id="secret3" style="text-align: center;">
  Secret #3
</h1>

> Keep track of your progress.

By keeping track of your progress and what you have accomplished, you will feel better about yourself and realize that all is not lost.

We all have attempted or currently use a To Do List, but have you ever thought about a &#8220;Done&#8221; List? I found out about this concept nearly a year ago and it has changed my life, and kept me motivated. The concept of the done list is to archive everything you have completed into a simple list, so I can look back on it and realize what I have accomplished and ultimately make myself feel better.

I use a service called <a href="https://idonethis.com/" target="_blank">IDoneThis</a> that sends me an email every day at 6pm asking what I have accomplished, and all I have to do is email them back and it adds it to my done list.

<h1 id="secret4" style="text-align: center;">
  Secret #4
</h1>

> Quit comparing yourself to others!

Comparing yourself to others will never get you to where you need to be.

Be your own person, don&#8217;t try to compare yourself to the people around you or the people you look up to. While it is a good thing to see and research where and why they succeeded, it’s bad to compare what you are doing to what others are or have done. You are you, and there’s no one else like it. You are given chances or distractions that they didn&#8217;t have. Your case is different than theirs, so stop comparing yourself to them!

<h1 id="secret5" style="text-align: center;">
  Secret #5
</h1>

> &#8220;If you were the person that you want to be, then what would that person do?&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.quora.com/Karl-Bradley-Saclolo" target="_blank">Karl Socolov</a>

Don&#8217;t think about the present, think about your future. Think about the person you want to be, think about what they would do differently if they are the person you want them to be. The person you want to be has the motivation and power to get the task done, so what would that person do?

This is the most perfect person you want to be, everything that you strive to become, they know all, and they know how to jump over any hurdle thrown at them. If you ask yourself what *they would do* then you will be able to get what you want and **need** to get it done. Get your motivation from your dreams, and that person is a part of your dreams.

<h1 id="secret6" style="text-align: center;">
  Secret #6
</h1>

> Get started.

Just get started. If you want to create an app &#8211; get started on learning that code. If you want to write that novel &#8211; get started on that first word. If you want to exercise &#8211; get up and start walking, get out the door, and don&#8217;t stop till you just can&#8217;t anymore.

Just do it. I have faith in you, you can get whatever you want done, done. Regardless of the challenges you may face, the only way to get it done &#8211; is to start.

If you follow and take to heart these 6 secrets, you will be able to get the motivation you need for whatever it is you want and need done. I have faith in you, you can do it!
