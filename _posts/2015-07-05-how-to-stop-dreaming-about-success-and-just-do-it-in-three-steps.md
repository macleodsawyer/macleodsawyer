Right now with our access to the Internet, our ability to learn anything we need at the tips of our fingertips (literally) we can achieve success better, faster, smarter, and easier than any other generation in history.

We all have dreams, every single one of us dreams about being successful in something. Whether that be in business, art, school, career, music, or even love - any of us can achieve that dream of success.

Now, not everyone will achieve the success they want, some people will not be able to even start doing what they truly want.

But, anyone that tries to achieve their dream will be able to achieve at least a part of it - and that is success.

In the grand scheme of things, most people can't reach complete success (could they if they tried hard enough? Of course! But not everyone will).

But most people can, and if they set their mind to it will achieve enough success to make themselves happy.

How can you achieve success?

# **1. Think different.**

You need to begin to think different, you have to kill the mindset that you CAN'T and instead think about how you WILL achieve success.

You have to think about the end goal in the long term and not about the short term goals (don't get me wrong those are great as well and you should think about them, but not as much).

You should have the mindset that there is no other option than to win.

# **2. Life is as a game.**

You have one life and there are no power-ups or "one-ups" to give you another chance.

You should start to view everything as a game and use that to your advantage.

> But how can I think of it as a game?

Each part of your life is a level, and each time you pass it, they will get harder but you will have the success of the last level to boost you to the end.

You need to start thinking competitively.

You need to start getting used to winning.

You need to do everything in your power to win against your opponents that are trying to beat you to the end.

If this means you need to use a blue shell, **then use your blue shell**.

If this means putting up shields around you to protect your image and other attacks then do it.

Doing everything in your power to win is what makes the difference between those who reach success and those who barely get off the ground.

# **3. The power of 'no'.**

Make a choice, and always know that 'no' is always a valid choice.

The power of 'no' is underrated and typically frowned upon in society. We are all made to believe that we should make everyone happy and by doing so we have to say 'yes'.

Stop trying to make others happy for a moment and work for yourself. 

Read my post on [viewing everything as optional.](http://macleodsawyer.com/2015/05/16/view-everything-as-optional/)

If someone asks you to do something for them but you know that you have more important things that day just tell them 'No'.

If a customer asks you to integrate a feature in your product, you can tell them no - but make sure to do it in a nice (less obvious) way!

Only say 'yes' when you absolutely need to, when you are 100% devoted to it, when you need to say it - not because you should.
