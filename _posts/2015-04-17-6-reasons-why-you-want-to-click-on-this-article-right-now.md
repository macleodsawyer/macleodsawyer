Try to prove me wrong. This article is 100% clickbait, and you will want to click on it right now or else you won&#8217;t ever find out what is inside this post right now (and trust me, you&#8217;ll want to know).

# 1. Clickbait works. 

It&#8217;s true, you only clicked on this article to read what I was going to say and why you would click on it. Looks like my evil plan has worked.

&nbsp;

  
The title adds a sense of mystery, it doesn&#8217;t make it a question like some would think, the title instead makes it a point to tell you that there are 6 reasons why you would want to click on this article, your human need for the answers to your curiosity got you into this mess.

# 2. You were committed to the title. 

By the time you finished reading the title, you were committed to it.

The title is written in sentence form, it has 12 words in it, seems laid back, and isn&#8217;t a normal &#8220;headline&#8221; (ex: &#8220;Apple announce new Macbook&#8221;). The title is about a sentence long, it&#8217;s not quick to read, and requires you to spend more time making sense of what it is.

By the time you finished reading it, you have all all ready invested your precious time into it and you don&#8217;t want to turn that into a waste.

Did I forget to mention it follows a formula?

[Nathalie Nahai][2] crafted this beautiful formula that you just proved that it&#8217;s right.

# 3. Knowledge is power. 

A natural human need is to know everything.

<img class="aligncenter" src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/78ff7b9cf65fc3dafb6b33ec5d3d3b3c/tumblr_mv4bc2Zhpg1sdply4o1_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" />

The human need to know everything about anything is a great tool to getting people to do what you want &#8211; especially for getting people to click on this article.

We all want to know more, we want to know more to make our lives better &#8211; and for some people this article may do just that, but for most you just won&#8217;t care.

Knowledge is power. The more we know, the better our life ***should*** be, because the more we know the better we will be able to change and adapt to anything in our way.

Not knowing anything is a pain in the ass, have you ever been in a room full of people that are talking about a specific topic and you&#8217;re just sitting there thinking &#8220;What the hell is going on? What does that mean? What does that do?&#8221; and then later you go and research it, or even better sit on your phone and research every thing that comes up as they bring it up? I bet you have.

We have all been there. We have all done that. And, we all want to know what is going.

The only way to avoid those situations is to know everything that is going on, so even if you don&#8217;t have a clue about the main point, you could talk about the smaller points that are going on.

Knowledge is power, and ignorance is a pain in the ass.

# 4. Numbers. 

And no, not the Lost numbers <del>(4815162342)</del>.

The title had a number, which signifies that it will be a list (and that is right!) <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150410-9-reasons-we-love-lists" target="_blank">and humans just love lists</a>.

Want to know what else humans love? *Something different.*

And that something different in the number is that it isn&#8217;t a &#8220;10&#8221; and it isn&#8217;t a &#8220;5&#8221;.

I chose &#8220;6&#8221; reasons both for the ease of writing it, it is just one above 5, and I just really like the number.

&nbsp;

But for the truth of it &#8211; everyone does things in groups of fives or tens (such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXbdMPezWN0" target="_blank">The Late Shows Top Ten List</a>, or the commonly heard Top Ten Places to Live, or whatever). and by printing there are SIX different things, you are more than likely going to click on it because its so different than normal (albeit there are more &#8220;6&#8221;&#8216;s on your feed because of these things than &#8220;5&#8221;&#8216;s.

It&#8217;s the same reason those books are called &#8220;101 science fair projects&#8221; and what not, because its different, its not a multiple of ten, its just different and stands out more.

# 5. Outsmarting the list.

You tried that didn&#8217;t you?

As you read the title on your news feeds, on your dashboards, [email][4], messenger, whatever it was that you saw this on and you were all ready guessing what was going to be on this list.

You wanted to prove to yourself you knew everything. That you were the great person that you like to think that you are. Well truth be told I knew you were going to do that, so I put reason right in here.

&nbsp;

# 6. Fake urgency.

They are crafted in such a way that they make you want to click on them, they make you want to read them, this article made you want to read it right here, right now.

When I added &#8220;right now&#8221; it tells you that you are full of energy, why? Because it added a sense of urgency to the article that it has to be read **right now **and not in a five minutes or next week.

Creating a sense of urgency is a guaranteed way to get people to click on anything, it makes it a need, and if you don&#8217;t fulfill that need you won&#8217;t feel good about yourself. It&#8217;s an emotional thing.

# 7. Boredom.

I wasn&#8217;t originally going to add this one &#8211; but I know there are a lot of you reading this right now, that saw the title and just knew exactly what I was going to do/say and just said &#8220;I have nothing better to do&#8221;* ***clicks*** *and then here we are*.*

* * *

I know I said 6, but you know what you made it this far you deserve a seventh.
