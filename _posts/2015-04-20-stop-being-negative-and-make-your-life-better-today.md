This post was started a long time ago, not on paper, but in my journey to not being negative. I learned how to stop being negative, and ultimately it made my life better the day I figured it out.

A year or so has passed, and I can promise you that not only will you feel better about yourself but you will feel loved, be acknowledged more, have your opinions heard, have more friends, have more opportunities, and have far less stress than you do right now. And best of all you will become motivated to do the things that you truly love.

# **1. Admit that you have a problem.** 

The first step in fixing a problem is to admit you have that problem.

If it&#8217;s hard for you to fully admit it (not half-heartily I&#8217;m taking completely admitting it to yourself) then ask yourself if you enjoy being around negative and hateful people.

You don&#8217;t. I can tell you that right now. You don&#8217;t. But if you continue being negative, you will become that person (or worse, *you are that person*). Ask yourself that question as you read this article and every time you say or do something negative. Constantly remind yourself that you don&#8217;t actually enjoy being negative, and that you want to stop.

# **2. Meditation** 

Seriously, I know this is cliché to talk about &#8211; but meditation is a great thing to get into the habit of doing.

I first started meditating when I was about 14, and it had a profound impact on my life, I could handle stress better, it helped me solve my biggest issues, and made me realize who I am. I still meditate to this day, nearly daily right before I go to bed. Not a lot of people know that, but I do.

Just spend fifteen to thirty minutes everyday and just close your eyes, breathe in and out, in and out, and just go from topic to topic in your head, don&#8217;t worry about staying on a topic for too long. Spend as much time on any topic that you need. My mind likes to switch to different topics quickly meaning I will go from thinking about that research paper I need to write, to Hemingway, to the impacts drinking has on my friends, to the inevitable demise of humanity, and then to that video of that cat that was in sync to &#8220;Sail&#8221;.

There is no real reason why any of that is connected, it&#8217;s just how my mind decided to think. Some time I think about nine hundred different things, and other days I only think about two things.

# **3. Write.**

I want you to get two pieces of paper and a pen.

Write down all the reasons why you hate something, write them all down as they come to you. Take a pen and paper and the topic write in a large font the topic that you hate. Then just start making bullet point after bullet point about that one thing, keep going for a good ten minutes or until you have exhausted yourself.

Now, take out the other piece of paper and think about something that you absolutely love. Write the topic across the top of the page just like you did before, and below it just create bullet point after bullet point about how much you love something and why you love it.

Which one felt better to write? Which one made you feel better about yourself? I can tell you. The second one did.

You much prefer writing out things that are easier, things that come more naturally, and in this case writing about the things you love are far easier and make you feel so much better about yourself. This is the same thing for your everyday, if you spend so much of your time being negative about something you will never be able to feel as great as you could be if you were being positive about it.

# **4. Don&#8217;t take everything so serious and stop worrying about things that don&#8217;t matter.**

It&#8217;s easier said than done, but if you get into the habit of not stressing about every other problem you will be able to accomplish so much more, be so much more productive, and just feel that much better about yourself.

Just keep in mind that you don&#8217;t take life so serious. Just go with the flow. If you go with the flow you won&#8217;t need to worry about being negative you only need to worry about being happy and the things that make you happy.

If you go with the flow and stop stressing out about every other problem you will be happier, you won&#8217;t think too hard about things that just don&#8217;t matter. And one way you can stop stressing out, is to stop worrying about things that just don&#8217;t matter to you.

We as a society spend too much time focusing on issues that shouldn&#8217;t matter to us. We shouldn&#8217;t worry about why Justin Bieber is in jail again, we shouldn&#8217;t worry about why [Insert Person Here] they cut their hair, why Miley Cyrus wore that one outfit on that one day instead of wearing that other outfit from another day.

You should just stop caring about the things that don&#8217;t matter, to learn to care more about the things that do. If you stop being so negative about the things that don&#8217;t matter to you it will feel better because instead of spending that time being hateful, you are instead replacing that time with being kind and nice to yourself and others.

I&#8217;m writing this all from personal experience and what worked for me.

I wasn&#8217;t always the kind upbeat person that I can be. There was a two-year period where I was very hate oriented on the things that just don&#8217;t matter. Whether my hate was because I was just an angst filled younger teenager, and that now I&#8217;ve grown up and began to mature I have no clue, but I hope this can help people of all ages.

I hope these tips can help. I really do, they helped me and several of my close friends and acquaintances that I have had the lovely chance to talk to about this.

Be a better person, I know that you can be. All it takes is to start today, and I promise you will be.
