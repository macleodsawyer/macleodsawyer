I initially posted this a tweetstorm, but have decided to elaborate more on it.

Twitters concept is great &#8211; short messages, telling exactly what you are doing in the simplest way. It&#8217;s brilliant. But thats where it stops, the concept is great, the delivery is.. well less than it could be for todays world.

Twitter has a great chance at acquiring the younger generation as well as the older with a few minor (could be considered major) changes.

# Twitter needs to get messaging right. 

&nbsp;

Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/now-on-twitter-group-direct-messages-and-mobile-video-capture" target="_blank">recently introduced group messaging</a>, and its a great way for them to increase their user retention rate but, their entire messaging platform needs to be rebuilt.

## Drop the limit. {#dropthelimit}

Some people may shoot me for saying this &#8211; but twitter needs to drop the 140 character limit inside it&#8217;s messaging system. No one can communicate in less than 140 characters in private messeges with someone, they could when twitter first started but users are now conversing far differently then they did in 2007.

## Launch a standalone app. 

This would solve so many issues, Twitter should launch a companion app for iPhone and Android, on top of having massaging in the main app they need a seperate app. Have the users be able to login with their twitter, and be displayed with a conversation list immediatley upon opening. Teenagers and young adults will love the fact that they can converse quickly without having another account for something, and something they can just *open* and not be bothered with a feed. I mean why else would Facebook do it?

## This will cause teenagers to use Facebook messenger less. 

Facebook messenger is my go to for messaging others, as well as nearly every other teenager I know. Why? Because it has no character limit, it allows us to send photos quickly, it opens directly to the conversation list, has a link to the facebook app (and a quick button to view their profiles in the main app).

Their messaging app is the only thing keeping Facebook popular among teenagers and young adults, and its tearing us apart. We hate facebook, like we really really **really** hate it. We hate that we are connected to our entire families, and the people we despise but have to stay friends with for x number of reasons. If Twitter opened the gates on allowing quick, fast, and easy messaging they would rule the game for young adults which will increase their revenue, activity, and everything else they would want.

# The web version is a mess. 

&nbsp;

The web version of twitter, and the app version no longer match. They tried, and failed, and its driving people away.

## Make up your mind, Twitter. 

Do you want us to have &#8220;classic RT&#8221; or not? In your app you encourage it when you click the &#8220;retweet&#8221; button, but where is it now in your desktop version? Oh wait&#8230; nowhere.

This drives my friends and I insane, we can quote the tweets in the app, saving it from deletion, but in the web version we can&#8217;t do that we can just share the tweet.

If you opened up the playing field here, and allowed both in the web version we would love to use Twitter (a little more) when we don&#8217;t have our phones on us, and are browsing on our laptops.

## Again&#8230; the messaging&#8230; 

Messaging on the desktop is a pain! You would expect a standalone page for messaging right? **You would be wrong, so very wrong.**

Instead of having a standalone full width and height page for messaging (like for example facebook, or tumblr, or myspace, or linkedin, or any other social network) it shows you this when you click on &#8220;messages&#8221;, which is fine and all but theres no option to open a standalone page! If you want to message, this is what you will be required to use.

![][3]  
Wish to switch between messages easily? That&#8217;s funny, have fun clicking the back and forth button a lot as it doesnt show your open messages on the side, because the conversation you&#8217;re currently in takes up the entire small modal popup.

## Notifications, or number of tweets I haven&#8217;t read yet? 

That&#8217;s the question if you are new to twitter, and it&#8217;s a question you shouldn&#8217;t have to ask.

![][4]

Facebook has a (1) which tells me I have one new notification pertaining to my account, either that be a like, friend request, comment, whatever it is &#8211; its pertaining directly to me. Twitter has a (41) which tells me there are 41 new tweets since I initially loaded the page.

### This is annoying. 

I am tired of seeing that number go up every other second, its annoying. Why? Because, it gives me hope that I have had 41 new interactions with people, but instead no, its telling me I have haven&#8217;t read 41 tweets. And thats just annoying, Twitter.

# Fix the spam. 

&nbsp;

Wish I didn&#8217;t have to say it, but Twitter fix your spam and abuse issue. You have way too much spam going through your system, I love you and all, but the spam has got to go.

I don&#8217;t really have to say much more about this, I mean your <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7982099/twitter-ceo-sent-memo-taking-personal-responsibility-for-the" target="_blank">CEO all ready sent your entire team a nice email about how bad it is.</a>

> If Twitter fixed it&#8217;s issues, it could take over as **the** app for young adults to use.

And I can&#8217;t wait for the day that happens, because Twitter is a great tool, but there are just a few issues that are killing it, and if fixed &#8211; could make it a lot of money, and make the service a 100x better to use.
