When will big bird take on the giant?

If they displayed all video uploads as tweets with emphasis on the video (like they already do) they could become a major competitor to YouTube from day one.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter could easily become the next YouTube, if they allowed longer uploads, a &quot;video&quot; tab on a profiles page, and view counts.</p>&mdash; Macleod Sawyer (@mxsawyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxsawyer/status/645779020420771840">September 21, 2015</a></blockquote>

To become a major player in the video world they need to be able to have 15+ minute video uploads, not the current 30 seconds only time limit.

A designated "video" tab would fit Twitter's aesthetic and could have a toggle to display as a gallery or displayed as chronoligical list (such as tweets are currently seen).

View counts would be needed to track how many visitors are watching and displayed to everyone publicly front and center.

if you gave a reason for people to use Twitter > Youtube you would have to incorpoate ads, and if you gave a slightly higher paycheck than YouTube does you would bring the larger YouTube accounts and all those followers to them.

Cut deals with them and have them put their videos on Twitter first, and then YouTube later and you would have instant new users and activity happening.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3/ It would bring in younger audiences more to share and talk about videos (increase in user growth and activity) through native RT&#39;s.</p>&mdash; Macleod Sawyer (@mxsawyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxsawyer/status/645782822800613377">September 21, 2015</a></blockquote>

Millenials love to share and converse with other people, by using nartive retweets of the Videos you will instantly be able to have videos being hsared to millions of people faster than you could on YouTube.

Native sharing in platform will lead to more views, more activity, more revenue (ads!), and better participation.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4/ Increase in <a href="https://twitter.com/twitter">@twitter</a> users, retention, user activity, and revenue. All the YT stars already use <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24twtr&amp;src=ctag">$twtr</a> why not launch Twitter Video?</p>&mdash; Macleod Sawyer (@mxsawyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxsawyer/status/645783397218971652">September 21, 2015</a></blockquote>

Call it Twitter Video, has the twitter name that people love, and tells you exactly what it is.

Twitter owns both Vine and Periscope, incorporate users Vine uploads is the "video" tab and have them be able to viewed in the same feed as the Twitter Videos. 

Use Periscope to take on the harldy used YouTube Live system and have a recorded area for when they published the recordings and have a "Currently Periscoping" (live streaming) identification on the users tweets next to their name (Perisope logo?) and have it be listed on the profile page under their description with a direct link to the periscope or the Periscope emebed on a tweet.

They're already lining up their cards to become Twitter Video, but will it happen? I hope so.
