Google recently announced their new logo, saying its a new age with this whisical childish (in a good way) Google doodle, but it's not new.

According to the announcement on the [official Google blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/google-update.html) on blogspot (yeah remember that?) the Google logo is brand new. 

> Today we’re introducing a new logo and identity family that reflects this reality and shows you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens. As you’ll see, we’ve taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs (such as tap, type and talk). 

Maybe to the public, but not to them. This logo has been in their vaults for over 3 years. 

It's not new, not to Google atleast, or well anyone that uses the Google Authenticator App.

The Google Authenticator app always was strange to me, because all other official Google apps had their colors, had their font, had something well "google-like" about them. 

Except the [Google Authenticator app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en). 

What is the authenticator app? Well it authenticates your logins to Google, and other networks using two-step authentication.

The last update to the app was in December of 2013, and it had that icon for a year or so before hand.

What does the app icon look like?

They are identical in every way, except the colors. 

Which means they've had this logo ready since before [their last logo remodel back in 2013.](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/9/4710634/redesigned-google-logo-found-in-chrome-for-android-beta)

Is this really anything groundbreaking? No. But it is interesting that we didn't get any leaks, we didn't get any knowledge of what was happening when they had this ready 2-3 years before they launched it. 

It's also fun to wonder, does this mean they have the next several logo changes planned? I guess we'll have to wait and see.
