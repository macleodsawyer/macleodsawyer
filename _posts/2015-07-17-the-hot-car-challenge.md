Kars4Kids has released a video of the ‘hot car challenge’ where they challenge people to sit in a car for ten minutes in the hot sun (without air conditioning) to experience what it’s like for children who are locked in their parents cars in the heat.

The temperature in a car can reach up to 109° within 15 minutes in the summer months. To put this in perspective 104° Temperature at which a child’s internal organs begin to shut down.

52 percent of all heatstroke deaths in cars are a result of someone forgetting a child is in the car (668 children’s deaths since 1998).

Please keep your kids safe, your friends kids safe, and if you see a child locked in a car without air conditioning call the police immediately.
