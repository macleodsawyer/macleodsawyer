Google recently announced their new logo, saying its a new age with this whisical childish (in a good way) Google doodle.

According to the announcement on the [official Google blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/google-update.html) on blogspot (yeah remember that?) the Google logo is brand new. 

> So why are we doing this now? Once upon a time, Google was one destination that you reached from one device: a desktop PC. These days, people interact with Google products across many different platforms, apps and devices—sometimes all in a single day. You expect Google to help you whenever and wherever you need it, whether it’s on your mobile phone, TV, watch, the dashboard in your car, and yes, even a desktop! Today we’re introducing a new logo and identity family that reflects this reality and shows you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens. As you’ll see, we’ve taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs (such as tap, type and talk). It doesn’t simply tell you that you’re using Google, but also shows you how Google is working for you. For example, new elements like a colorful Google mic help you identify and interact with Google whether you’re talking, tapping or typing. Meanwhile, we’re bidding adieu to the little blue “g” icon and replacing it with a four-color “G” that matches the logo. 

Maybe to the public, but not to them. I believe this logo has been in their vaults for over 3 years. Why? Because the "G" that they were talking about how that what will be on mobile devices now instead of the big blue "G" that we had yesterday. (R.I.P Big Blue G)

That G? It's not new, not to Google atleast, or well anyone that uses the Google Authenticator App.

The Google Authenticator app always was sdtrange to me, because all other official Google apps had their colors, had their font, had something well "google-like" about them. 

Except the [Google Authenticator app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en). 

What is the authenticator app? Well it authenticates your logins to Google, and other networks using two-step authentication.

> Google Authenticator generates 2-step verification codes on your phone.
Enable 2-step verification to protect your account from hijacking by adding another layer of security. With 2-step verification signing in will require a code generated by the Google Authenticator app in addition to your account password.

The last update to the app was in December of 2013, and it had that icon for a year or so before hand.

What does the app icon look like?

They are identical in every way, except the colors. 

Which means they've had this logo ready since before [their last logo remodel back in 2013.](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/9/4710634/redesigned-google-logo-found-in-chrome-for-android-beta)

Is this really anything groundbreaking? No. But it is interesting that we didn't get any leaks, we didn't get any knowledge of what was happening when they had this ready 2-3 years before they launched it. 

It's also fun to wonder, does this mean they have the next several logo changes planned? I guess we'll have to wait and see.
