Migrating from the enemy (WordPress) was not my original plan last night, but it just so happens it well, happened. 

I originally was just going to mess around with the design of the site and fix all the little UI bugs that have been bothering me for weeks. 

While I was in the process of fixing the bugs I was quickly reminded as to why I absolutely **hate** and want to kill WordPress. 

PHP is not my favorite language, nor should it be **anyone** elses favorite language. To put it short: It's a pain to deal with since the code is so disgusting. 

WordPress is slow, cumbersome, annoying, and last week while doing upgrades the site visited death as it was visited by the infamous *white screen of death*. 

{% include ads.html %}

So, last night I sat down and started researching and finding some *awesome* new blogging platforms, one of which was Jekyll. 

To put that one short: Jekyll is easy to use, and fantastic since the code is so minimally beautiful. 

I wish I had time to go in depth as to what Jekyll is for people who are new to this sort of stuff (A post for another day? Yes.) so if you want to read more click [here](http://jekyllrb.com).

I am hosting with [GitHub](http://github.com/) using their GitHub Pages features (which is so cool). 

One of the pluses is not only is it open sourced and easy to edit my code and write posts (using Markdown!) it's also **free**. 

That's right, no more hosting bills. Thank the gods. 

So far I am really enjoying it, over the last 12 or so hours I have taught myself everything needed to run Jekyll and create an original website design (Do you like it? Do you hate it? Let me know!).

I was able to completely move all my posts, permalinks, and images from WordPress to Jekyll with relative ease using [this plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/) for WordPress. There were a few hiccups along the way, but due to how easy Jekyll is I was able to quickly fix those issues. 

Along with that, due to how Jekyll creates and uses Static posts, the site is not roughly 150% faster or so. So that's pretty great.
