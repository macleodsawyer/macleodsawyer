I am cutting all projects except for [CharityDrops.org](https:/;/charitydrops.org) as it requires my full attention.

All other projects such as Read&#x7c;Less, Avada Browser, The planned podcast, YouTube, and nearly every other side project of mine will be put on the back burner. This *does not* mean I will not go back to them and work on them in the future, this just means they will be on indefinite hold until further notice.

> Why?

I realize many of you were looking forward to the awesomeness that is [Read&#x7c;Less](http://ReadLess.co/) and especially my Avada Browser launching for public use, but its all becoming too much and it is driving me into a form of depression due to the amount of stress associated with each individual projects issues and needed leadership.

I have chosen out of all my projects to focus entirely on CharityDrops due to it's importance to help potentially millions of people, it's a project I have been working on in the background for over a year, and it’s nearly ready for release and I am _beyond_ excited. It isn’t ready yet, but it will be very very soon! 

The only other 'projects' not being put on hold will be majority of my blogs on tumblr, and KomaClick.

I need to do this so I can deliver the best experience I can with CharityDrops.
