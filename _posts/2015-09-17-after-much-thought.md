I am cutting all projects except for [CharityDrops.org](https:/;/charitydrops.org) as it requires my full attention.

All other projects such as Read|Less, Avada Browser, The planned podcast, YouTube, and nearly every other side project of mine will be put on the back burner. This *does not* mean I will not go back to them and work on them in the future, this just means they will be on indefinite hold until further notice.

CharityDrops has been in development for over a year, and it’s nearly ready for release and I am excited. It isn’t ready yet, but it will be very very soon. 

I realize many of you were looking towards [Read|Less](http://ReadLess.co/) and especially my Avada Browser, but its all becoming too much and it is driving me into a form of depression because of the amount of stress associated with each individual projects issues and needed leadership.

This blog will continue as will my other ones on tumblr, and KomaClick.

Again, sorry, but I need to do this so i can deliver the best experience I can with CharityDrops.
