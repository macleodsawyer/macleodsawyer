Sounds pretty funky right? 

#### That&#8217;s because it is. 

[UptownFunkify.com][1] is the greatest website on the planet, why? Because it plays the greatest song out today &#8211; 

# Uptown Funk. {#uptownfunk}

It&#8217;s a stupid and fun little project of mine, that basically is just a giant play button that plays uptown funk whenever you need it over and over and over and over and over and over.

> But that&#8217;s stupid!

Why of course it is! But, its great, its a little social experient that I will be keeping track of (although it was originally an amusing joke and an inherent need for an emergency uptown funk button)

> Okay, how much time and money did you waste on this idiotic thing?

I spent $15 for hosting (digitalocean) and the domain (namecheap), and wasted an hour of what should&#8217;ve been sleep getting the energy I needed for the school day ahead (which by the way I&#8217;m writing this in class right now, and I seriously needed that hour of sleep). 

#### It&#8217;s the website you never knew you needed. 

‘Cause UptownFunk(ify) gon’ give it to you,

Before we leave   
Imma tell y’all a lil’ something   
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up   
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up   
I said Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up   
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up 

### [Don’t believe me just click it (come on)][1]
