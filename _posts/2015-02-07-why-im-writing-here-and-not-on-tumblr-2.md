I come from a tumblr background &#8211; I currently run over 15 blogs, I have nearly half a million followers on tumblr, and manage around 10,000,000+ shares monthly. Every time I make a post on tumblr I know that it will immediately get shares and responses within seconds and let me tell you, **its absolutely fantastic**.

But, I am moving away from tumblr to a more personal blog, somewhere where I can be myself, post what I want, and write complete articles in long form without any followers attached to this blog. Basically, I&#8217;m starting from scraych.

> But why on earth would you do that? Can&#8217;t you do all of that on tumblr?

#### Yes, and no. 

Yes, because I can write what I want. I can post images, videos, audio, links, and text posts on tumblr. 

No, because on tumblr you will always have that fear that you staff could at any moment decide to terminate your blog causing you to lose all your posts, all your followers, all the work you put into it, everything you had ever catalouged, in a blink an eye gone because staff *&#8220;felt like it&#8221;*. 

Owning your own blog, hosted on your own server, ran by yourself and no one else, creates a sense of security of always knowing that I won&#8217;t be censored, that my account won&#8217;t be terminated due to a hack (lost nearly 200,000 followers two months ago for this very reason), or that I won&#8217;t wake up one day and discover that I lost 800 followers because I reblogged the wrong post onto my main blog instead of my sideblog. 

On top of all of this, it&#8217;s just far easier to write longform articles and thoughts here than on tumblr.

> How is this any different to writing long text posts on tumblr?

Tumblr is built to have short one sentence rants, puns, or to get information out quickly that takes no effort or thought. 

What&#8217;s different? Everythings different, tumblr gives you a smaller area to write, doesn&#8217;t allow you to embed other than youtube videos into your posts (even then its a brand new feature, and the youtube embeds are way too small to do anything), I can&#8217;t change my font-size. font-color, font-type, padding, alignment and type (left, right, centered, justified, etc), I can&#8217;t do anything a normal blogger can, and god forbid tumblr was ***supposed*** to be a blogging site, a full fledged site made for real blogging, but instead its now a &#8220;micro-blogging&#8221; site, little bits of information, that is read in a split second, reblogged, and then forgetten. 

At least here I can do everything tumblr posts can&#8217;t, and my posts will be read for a lot longer than 2 seconds, and **hopefully** won&#8217;t be forgotten as easy. (please don&#8217;t let this post be forgotten, you should really go ahead and tweet or post about this post).

#### I won&#8217;t be leaving tumblr. 

Don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what this post was about, I will still be active on tumblr, I will still be writing there, and posting as much as usual, but all my rants, all my projects, all my feelings will be here in longform for all the reasons above and more. 

And one of those reasons that I haven&#8217;t mentioned is the fact that this just feels **waaaaaaayyyy** more natural. Tumblr you are confined to a few lines, few options, and few, well, anything else you can think of. Here I can do anything I want, I can&#8217;t be terminated, I can format how I want, and it just feels so good to have a specific place to just write a few hundred words and get it all out without a care in the world. 

Thanks for reading my first longform blog post on my new (non-tumblr) blog, you guys are great.
