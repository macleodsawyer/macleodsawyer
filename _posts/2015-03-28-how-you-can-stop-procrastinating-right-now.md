We all suffer from procrastination. It&#8217;s not news, and it drives us all insane.

<!--more-->

No one wants to do that one thing from work, that one thing for school, or sometimes even go see that friend you haven’t seen in a decade. I man why would you when instead you could just stay where you are on your couch *(or bed)* watching that latest season of House of Cards on Netflix?

We need to change your current mindset, and there is only one way of doing that.

# Stop Procrastinating right now. 

I wish it was as easy as just telling you that, but nothing is ever that easy (except maybe watching this cat video below again and again and again).

It&#8217;s an issue we all want to overcome, we know the consequences if we don’t get that one (or many) things done. Yet for whatever reason, no matter what we try &#8211; we cannot stop it. We cannot stop the sickness that is Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or those amazing videos of cats on YouTube we always end up somehow watching without meaning to.

### Change your environment. 

Just get up. Move to the other side of the room, go to another room, or even go outside. Anything to get you away.

I like to walk, I just walk until it feels just right to stop. If you go to somewhere new it will give you a drive to finish what you have started.

A new environment will give you a cleaner mind. Everything will get simpler, and easier to handle. The headache that was an excuse for not getting anything done disappears and you can finally get to work.

Make sure wherever you go it does need include a couch, make sure it has something that you won&#8217;t lounge in, and something that will keep you moving (whether that be mind or body).

### Drop the unnecessary things. 

Leave everything you don&#8217;t need for the task at the door before you leave.

Do you really need your phone to clean your room? No! Do you really need to have the TV playing House of Cards while you do that important write up for your boss? No!

Drop what aren&#8217;t needed **right now** and get adjusted, it&#8217;s hard. But within the first five minutes of not having unnecessary things diverting your attention you will become productive and at ease with yourself.

If that means logging out of Facebook, twitter, Instagram, Tumblr &#8211; **THEN DO IT!**

If that means turning off your computer &#8211; **THEN DO IT!**

If that means going underground and not talking to anyone for a few days &#8211; **THEN DO IT!**

As long as you keep the unnecessary distractions close by, you will never be able to accomplish what needs to be done! Drop them!

### Break what needs to be done into parts by task and time. 

Have a massive project that’s terrifying to think about taking on? Break it apart!

If you break the project into parts it will become easier to manage. Instead of worrying about 45 different things at once, you only have to worry about one thing &#8211; the one thing that **needs** to get done.

> Divide your work into manageable time segments.

For example: I have 2 hours worth of studying to do, so I’ll do thirty minutes of studying, once I&#8217;m finished with those thirty minutes I will spend the next thirty relaxing and watching 30 minutes of TV, and so forth.

The better you break up your time, the better you will be. One method you can use to delegate your time is a [Pomodoro timer][1], they are an excellent tool to getting anything done.

### Make lists and set deadlines. 

Even if it doesn&#8217;t have an official deadline, make a deadline, and write it down.

If you create a deadline and write it down you will become guilt tripped into finishing the task. Have a large project with many parts (like we discussed above)? Make individual deadlines for them and make sure you **get them done**.

For each task you finish you can &#8220;tick&#8221; or cross off your list will make you feel a lot better. This will become extremely satisfying and it also keeps you organized and gets things done.

### Create consequences. 

No one likes consequences, they just completely suck. Who in their right mind wants to punish themselves? Productive people don&#8217;t, so they work to not be punished.

Alongside the deadlines you have hopefully created, add a consequence and make it out of an ordinary luxury that you have.

For example: &#8220;If I don’t finish this by the end of today, I will not allow myself to go to the Movies with John or get that coffee from my local coffee shop (remember shop local!).&#8221;

This way it will create an urgency to finish. It makes it needed to be accomplished so you can enjoy the little things (and get your daily caffeine intake the next day).

### Treat Yourself!

</center>You remember when I said to make yourself consequences from the little things? Well, you should also make some awesome awards for yourself.

If you **really** need to get something done then make yourself a deal &#8211; if you finish X you will let yourself Y (where Y is something you don&#8217;t typically do).

Go crazy, go out to that new restaurant, go out to the mall, go get yourself those shoes, go get yourself that new computer, and go ask that guy/girl out!

Just make sure that once you have accomplished what needs to be done &#8211; you will give yourself a gift, the more you do this, and the more your mind will become used to it.

Think of it like you are training a dog, you tell them to dog to get a ball and in return you give it a bone &#8211; after a while it will get the ball on its own because it *knows* it will get a gift for being awesome. Teach your mind that every time it gets something finished it will get a gift.
