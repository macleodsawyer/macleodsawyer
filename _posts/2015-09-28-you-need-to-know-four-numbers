78, 80, 80, and 83.


These are what the ages of four supreme court justices will be in 2016, which means the next president very well could choose the next four supreme court justices when those four retire within the next eight years.

Why does this matter? Because the supreme court control all our laws, and we need supreme court justices that will be on the right side of the history. 

Who nominates the supreme court justices? The president. 

Who would pick the justices the best? **Bernie Sanders**, who has a track record stemming back to [marching with MLK with civil rights](www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/29/399818581/5-things-you-should-know-about-bernie-sanders), has been a supporter of [LGBT+ rights since before the 60′s](http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/bernie-sanders-was-full-gay-equality-40-years-ago), been [against the war on drugs](http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Bernie_Sanders_Drugs.htm), against going to [war for profit gain](http://www.ontheissues.org/International/Bernie_Sanders_War_+_Peace.htm), isn’t owned by any one [(he will not take any donations from corporations)](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/h-a-goodman/bernie-sanders-wont-accept-money-from-billionaires-donald-trump-donated-100000-to-hillary-clinton_b_7799576.html), [believes in womens rights](http://mic.com/articles/119074/5-times-bernie-sanders-spoke-the-feminist-truth), believes that [free higher education is a right](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/08/bernie-sanders-higher-education_n_7026884.html), advocates f[or single payer healthcare](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/30/sanders-advocates-for-single-payer-health-care-system-on-medicare-anniversary/), and is against [big banks (wants to break them up into smaller entities)](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-us-presidential-hopeful-sanders-break-up-the-big-banks-2015-5). 

This is the president who we need to choose the next four supreme court justices.

This is the president who owes no one, but the people who voted for him. 

This is the president who hasn’t swayed from their beliefs for over 40 years.

This is the president who has always been on the right side of the history against all odds.

**This is the president we need.**
