You've sat down and tried to go through your email and it's just a mess of thousands of conversations people have tried to start with you, you have started with others, and just thread after thread of spammy newsletters (whether they are actually spam is a whole different point). 
   
   I've been there. You've been there. We've all been there.
   
   You've sat on your phone or computer and attempted to answer an email someone sent you detailing every little thing and the only thing that you can think of is "Oh good god I don't have time for this right now" because you feel like you should match them in content, information, and even worse *length*. 
   
   Well, heres a life hack you wish you had thought of before: **short responses**. 
   
   A simple short response is something I learned to use correctly about six months ago when I looked at my inbox on tumblr and it had over 10,000 messages that I hadn't had the time nor energy to respond to. 
   
   What do I mean by "short" responses? To put simply it's just basically a response to an email or question with simple answers.
   
   Easy right? You should definitely start using this skill.

   Basically all you do is respond with all the information that they (the other side of the conversation) needs, there is absolutely no need to write a detailed response to a detailed message that **doesn't** need one. 
   
   The best example of this is from the new biography of the absolutely phenomenal (and my role model) Elon Musk.
   
   >  Davis, like Brogan and plenty of other SpaceX engineers, has had Musk ask for the seemingly impossible. His favorite request dates back to 2004. SpaceX needed an actuator that would trigger the gimbal action used to steer the upper stage of Falcon 1. Davis had never built a piece of hardware before in his life and naturally went out to find some suppliers who could make an electromechanical actuator for him. He got a quote back for $120,000. “Elon laughed,” Davis said. “He said, ‘That part is no more complicated than a garage door opener. Your budget is five thousand dollars. Go make it work.’” Davis spent nine months building the actuator. At the end of the process, he toiled for three hours writing an e-mail to Musk covering the pros and cons of the device. The e-mail went into gory detail about how Davis had designed the part, why he had made various choices, and what its cost would be. As he pressed send, Davis felt anxiety surge through his body knowing that he’d given his all for almost a year to do something an engineer at another aerospace company would not even attempt.<br><br>Musk rewarded all of this toil and angst with one of his standard responses. He wrote back,**“Ok.”**

   
   That's it, a simple, single, short "Ok". That's all he needed, thats all Elon Musk supplied. Elon Musk gave the best answer that he could have given.
   
   Have any questions about it? Shoot back a quick question for clarification and he would probably shoot back a simple short response answering your question. 
   
   If you're short on time or energy, short responses are perfect for these sorts of situations.
   
   Using this method of answering in simple responses allows you to quickly email everyone back, keep the conversation going, and give them a response thats more definitive than a lengthy email that may or may not turn out to be convoluted or confusing to the point that the other person thinks that what your answer is to something could be vastly different than what you intended. 
   
   Keep it simple. Keep it minimal. Keep it short.

   Just give them what they want and move on to the next thing, theres no need be doing something that wastes your time, when you could be reaching the same conclusion 10,000% faster and save everyone a whole bunch of time that we borrow. 
   
   It may feel awkward doing it at first (and you may personally hate it when people do this) but it truly is the best way to get through information and opinions quickly. After you start using this in your day-to-day emailing life - or life in general - you will surely realize how useful this little "hack" is.

  Discuss: Do you currently or are you going to start using short responses when needed?
