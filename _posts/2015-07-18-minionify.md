Minions currently grace every part of life thanks to the brilliant marketing team behind the [Minions Movie](http://www.minionsmovie.com/) which came out earlier this summer. 

Because of the popularity of it, I decided to build a chrome extention called "Minionify (Children to Minion)" that you can download now on the Google Chrome store.

The extention replaces all related words of "children" to "minion" for several reasons. 

Now why would I do this? For two reasons.

## 1. It's funny. 
I was bored, I woke up, wanted to test out making chrome extensions - made a text replacer based on [cloud to butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

## 2. I wanted to draw attention to a good cause. 
I wanted to draw attention [Children International](http://children.org), which works to help children all around the world.

Children International improves the lives of children and youth by providing basic necessities, critical benefits and services, programs that support long-term development and opportunities that prepare them for success.

Why did I choose them and not others that focus on children? Because in 2014 [over 82% of Children Internationalâ€™s total expenses went to support the programs and activities that directly affect sponsored children.](https://www.children.org/FileRoot/1/Docs/Annual-Report.pdf)

When you donate to Children International you help:

- Address additional and often urgent medical needs like tuberculosis and provide emergency food programs for children in need.
- Offer additional educational opportunities for sponsored children and youth, including tutors, job and life skills workshops, scholarships and more.
- Maintain preventive health programs like our anti-parasite campaign that impact hundreds of thousands of people.
- Continue providing benefits to children who have lost their sponsors but still need assistance.
- Deliver relief supplies to victims of disasters, including shelter, food, water, clothing, medicine and rebuilding supplies.
