You need to stop using your current password, right now. 

Passwords are some of the most outdated, flawed, and vulnerable methods to protect your identity and information. So stop using them. 

A password in its simplest form is simply, a word. And a single word is one of the easiest things to crack, and the most used objects in a password. 

Sure you can fIlL tHeM wItH aLl sorts of random uppercase and lowercase letters, and yes you can even throw in some num63r5 in their and make it harder to crack. And don't get me wrong they do slightly, But, they still just aren't secure. 

And you need your passwords to be as secure as possible. After all your entire life is online now, and if someone really wants to get access to your information then using a password could just be opening the door wide open for them to abuse.

## Passwords are out, passphrases are in.

Yeah, that's right kill the pass**word** and go for a pass**phrase**. 

What do I mean by that? I legitimately mean, change your password from "muffin" to "muffinsarethebestfood". 

They are harder to decipher and ultimately keeps your accounts (and important information) safer than "muffin". 

Not only are they more secure, they are also easier to remember. 

People are prone to remember phrases, they are prone to remembering things said in sentence form, *not individual words*. 

## Passwords are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computers to guess.

When I started writing this I remembered a comic xkcd produced a long time ago, that I absolutely loved called "Password Strength"

You see the math in the second and fifth panel? Yeah it's still true. 

Passwords are inherently evil, so seriously just stop using them.

> But, but, it would take longer to type!

You would be surprised at the speed at which you can type a phrase you know versus a password that you have no relationship with and is filled with random letters and punctuation and spelling.

Seriously, ditch your current passwords (you probably should anyways) and go for a safe(r), more secure, better, faster, and easier to remember alternative that is the pass**phrase**.
