I'm a full stack front-end web developer, designer, and social media organizer.

I have over 500,000 organically grown followers on Tumblr managing millions of shares a months (somewhere north of 20million) through social marketing.

I have worked with Twitter & Branch in finding bugs and vulnerabilities to increase user (and service) safety.

I have experience managing with my startup Activity+ that was acquired by Bettr.io in July of 2014.

I have created <a href="http://uptownfunkify.com" target="_blank">websites</a> that have surpassed over 1.5 million views within a week with minimal marketing.

I also really love staying busy and working and would to work with you.
