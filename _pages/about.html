<p>My name is Macleod Sawyer and I am a blogger, developer, entrepreneur, and self-proclaimed minimalist.</p>

<p>I am founder of <a href="https://charitydrops.org">CharityDrops.org</a>, the easiest and best place to donate to the causes that you love and cherish every month.</p>

<p>I am also the founder of <a href="http://readless.co/">Read|Less</a> which is the top news of the past 24 hours for that "I'm still tired and don't want to get out of bed" morning groove.</p>

<p>I also have over half a million followers on sites such as Tumblr under the username <a href="http://mxcleod.com/">mxcleod</a>, where I post my thoughts and opinions on science fiction, activism, humor, and give out advice.</p>
