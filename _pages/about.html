<p>My name is Macleod Sawyer and I am an eighteen year old blogger, developer, entrepreneur, and minimalist.</p>

<p>I had my first startup acquired at 16, and am now founder of <a href="https://charitydrops.org">CharityDrops.org</a>, the easiest and best place to donate to the causes that you love and cherish.</p>

<p>I have over half a million followers on sites such as Tumblr under the username <a href="http://mxcleod.com/">mxcleod</a>, where I post my thoughts and opinions on science, politics, activism, humor, and generally good vibe.</p>
