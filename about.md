## Hey! My name is Macleod Sawyer.

I am a 17 year old blogger, developer, entrepreneur, minimalist, and nerd.

And to clarify you pronounce my name as "Muh-Cloud".
 
I spend most of my time making some pretty cool things. You can view a few of my projects by clicking [here](/projects).

I waste a lot of my time over on tumblr on a blog called ['mxcleod'](http://mxcleod.tumblr.com/) where I have accumulated about half a million followers in less than three year or so. Which gives me about 10-20million shares a month (and access to start viral memes for some reason) that reach and estimated 50million+ people every month. 

So that's kind of cool. 

I am also a member of <a href="https://www.googleforentrepreneurs.com/">Google For Entreprenuers</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/startups/">Google Startup Launch</a>.

You can typically find me over on twitter, [@mxsawyer](https://twitter.com/mxsawyer).
